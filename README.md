## Prereqs

To create the Codespace, you'll need the following:

### Azure for Student Subscription (or existing Azure subscription)

Creating an Azure for Student subscription is a three-step process.

    1. Create a new Outlook.com email account
    2. Redeem your Student Verification Code
    3. Activate your subscription

Click [HERE](https://github.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/tree/master/docs/AzureForStudentVerificationActivation.pdf) to open the AzureForStudentVerificationActivation.pdf which has more details.

Here are the basic directions if you don't use the pdf.

`Step 1:` Create a new Outlook.com email account:

Open a new In-Private Browser session and navigate to https://signup.live.com and create a new Outlook.com email account

* Click on the `Get A New Email Address` button
* Add in the email address you would like to use - if the username is not
available Microsoft will offer several suggestions
* Create a new password for the account
* Add in your name, country/region and date of birth and validate using
Captcha

The account will be created
* Select More Actions and click View Inbox

`Step 2:` Redeeming a Microsoft Azure Student Verification Code:

Open a new In-Private Browser session and navigate to: http://aka.ms/azure4students

It is recommended you close all browsers and open a new In-Private Browser
session. Other logins can persist and cause errors during the activation step.

* Click the `Activate now` button to get started.

* Verify your identity with a phone number
* Select the Verification mode: Verification code
* Enter your 25-character verification code and click `Verify Academic Status`.

`Note` It may take up to 5 minutes to process the redemption.

`Step 3:` Activate your subscription:

* When the redemption process is completed, it will redirect to the sign-up
page.

* Enter your account information and click `Next`.
* Click the agreement check box and click the `Sign up` button.

`Note` It may take a few minutes to process the request.

* Your Azure subscription is ready
* You can check the balance of your Azure Pass Credits on https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance


### GitHub Account - Configure your GitHub

If you don't already have a GitHub Username you can [Create one HERE](https://github.com).  You should use the same email you used to create your Microsoft Account.

1. Click [Here](https://github.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS) and sign in with your GitHub Username

2. Click on Fork in the EphrataTEALS Repository

    - Click on Fork

        ![fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/fork.png)

    - Click on your GitHub username

        ![forkdest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/forkdest.png)

3. You now have a copy of the EphrataTEALS repository in your GitHub

    ![yourcopy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/yourcopy.png)

    My username was darsch so the repository shows up as darsh/EphrataTEALS.  Yours should be `<GitHubusername>`/EphrataTEALS


### Visual Studio Online Codespace - Configure your Codespace

Set up the codespace environment:

- Click [HERE](https://online.visualstudio.com/) and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

[![Open in Visual Studio Online](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?style=social&url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2Fvso-badge)](https://online.visualstudio.com)

1. Click `Create Codespace`

![codespacesCreate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/codespacesCreate.png)

- If you don't already have Visual Studio Online plan, create one. This is used to track resource utlization by your Visual Studio Online environments.

![codespacesCreateBillingPlan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/codespacesCreateBillingPlan.png)

    Then create an environment with the following settings:

![codespacesCreateEnv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataSnowman/EphrataTEALS/master/images/codespacesCreateEnv.png)

**Environment Name**: A name for your environment - for example, `Java-Dev`

**Git Repository**: `<GitHubUsername>/EphrataTEALS`

**Instance Type**: `Basic (Linux) 2 cores, 4GB RAM`

**Suspend idle environment after**: `30 minutes`

Click `Create` button

2. Wait for the environment to be created, and then click `Connect` to connect to it. This will open a browser-based instance of Visual Studio Code.

3. Wait for a minute or so while the environment is set up for you. It might look like nothing is happening, but in the background we are installing some extensions that you will use in the labs. 

4. After the REFRESH NOW file has appeared, refresh the web page to ensure all of the extensions are loaded and you're ready to start.
