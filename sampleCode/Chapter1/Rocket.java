     * We are going to write a program to print the following to
     * the console:
     * 
     *    /\
     *   /  \
     *  /    \
     *  \    /
     *   \  /
     *    \/
     *  \    /

     *    \/
     *    /\
     *   /  \
     *  /    \
     *    /\
     *   /  \
     *  /    \
     * +------+

     * |United|
     * |States|
     * +------+

     *    /\

     * 
     * Extra: If you finish early, try any of the below challenges:
     * A. Make a new picture using the shapes from this lab.
     * B. Create a static method to draw a new shape (ex: circle).
     *    Use it to draw a new picture.
     * C. Make your own ASCII art! Use Pikachu for inspiration or
     *    find examples online.
